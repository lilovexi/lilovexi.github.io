To my dear, my sweet heart,
Do you know 
I love you so soo much
though you are far far away from me
You, the rainbow after the rain are alike
So marvellous, so bright and so beautiful
 
Do you know
I miss you so soo much
cause you are deep deep into my soul
You, the sea under starry sky are the same
So fantastic, so magical and so boundless
